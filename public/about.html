<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Dan and I started this new journey of learning how to code because I felt it was time to take the next step
  for my and my wife's future.
</p>

<p>Currently I live in Canada, where I've been born and raised.  I studied art and took classes in art college, however I
  never thought I was any good at art; and before I could finish I moved to South Korea for a year and a half before returning
  to Canada.
</p>

<p>I completed College with an Associate Degree of Arts English, and am now studying a skill I've wanted to learn for a very long
  time, web design.  I stream on Twitch when I have free time (Which isn't very often anymore...) or play video games.  But now,
  when I'm not working, I study my new skill.  It's my goal to live in Japan one day, and I hope this skill will open a door to pursue
  my goals.
